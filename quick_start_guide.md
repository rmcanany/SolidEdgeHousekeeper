# Quick Start Guide

## INSTALLATION

The quickest way to get Housekeeper is to visit the [<ins>**Releases Page**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/releases) on GitHub. The latest version will be at the top of the list. 

Click the file `SolidEdgeHousekeeper-VYYYY.N.zip` (`YYYY` = Year, `N` = Release Number).  You may have to expand the Assets dropdown to see it.  Your browser should prompt you to save it. 

Choose a convenient location on your machine. Extract the zip file (right-click > Extract All).  Verify the directory is not read-only or blocked (right-click > Properties).  The program needs write access to function properly.  

Double-click `Housekeeper.exe` to run.  The first time you do, you may get a `Windows Protected Your PC` message.  You can click `More Info` followed by `Run Anyway` to launch the program. 


## OPERATION

Select which files to process on the **Home Tab**.  Select what to do on the **Task Tab**.  To start execution, click the `Process` button.  The **Home Tab** looks like this.

</p>

The basic steps to select files is as follows.  (See **Next Steps** below for more ways to do it).  
- *Either* select a single folder by clicking ![Folder](Resources/icons8_Folder_16.png).  
- *Or* select a folder and sub folders by clicking ![Folders](Resources/icons8_folder_tree_16.png).  
- Populate the list by clicking ![Update](Resources/Synch_16.png) (it should be colored orange).  
- To start over, clear the list by clicking ![Remove All](Resources/icons8_trash_16.png).

The **Task Tab** looks like this.

</p>


The basic steps to configure a task are as follows.
- Click the left-most checkbox to enable a task.
- Select the desired file type(s).  These are the checkboxes to the right of the `Enable` button.  In order, they select `Assembly`, `Part`, `Sheetmetal`, and `Draft`. If a file type is not applicable for a task, its checkbox is disabled.
- If there any options, set those as desired.
- If you are unsure of what the command does, or how it works, click the right-most blue icon.  It will take you directly to the help topic for that command.

When processing is complete, if any errors are found, a log file will open showing each error and the file in which it occurred. 

You can interrupt the program before it finishes. While processing, the Cancel button changes to a Stop button.  Just click that to halt execution.  It may take several seconds to register the request.  It doesn't hurt to click it a couple of times.

Oh, one last thing.  This is not a perfect program.  It processes a large number of files in a short amount of time.  It can do damage at the same rate.  We have run it on thousands of our files, but none of yours.  *Back up any files before using it.*

## NEXT STEPS

- [<ins>**Filtering**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/blob/master/HelpTopics.md#filtering)  Explains how to refine the list using property and/or file wildcard filters.
- [<ins>**Tasks**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/blob/master/HelpTopics.md#task-tab)  Provides details on the task interface, including how to customize it for your own needs.

If you have some other topic in mind, try the [<ins>**Table of Contents**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/blob/master/HelpTopics.md#task-tab#readme).  Click the button on the header bar of that page that looks like this ![Table of Contents](My%20Project/media/table_of_contents_icon.png).  It has links to all the major sections in the documentation.

If you get stuck, head over to the [<ins>**Solid Edge Forum**</ins>](https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/topic/0TO4O000000MihiWAC/solid-edge).  There are lots of experienced users who are glad to help out.
