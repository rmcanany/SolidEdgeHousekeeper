# Quick Start Guide

## INSTALLATION

The quickest way to get Housekeeper is to visit the [<ins>**Releases Page**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/releases) on GitHub. The latest version will be at the top of the list. 

Click the file `SolidEdgeHousekeeper-VYYYY.N.zip`, where `YYYY` is the year and `N` is the release number.  You may have to expand the Assets dropdown to see it.  Your browser should prompt you to save it. Choose a convenient location on your machine. Extract the zip file (probably by right-clicking and selecting Extract All). Double-click the `.exe` file to run.

The first time you run it, you may get a `Windows Protected you PC` message.  You can click `More Info` followed by `Run Anyway` to launch the program. 


## OPERATION

Select which files to process on the **Home Tab**.  Select what to do on the **Task Tab**.  To start execution, click the `Process` button.  The **Home Tab** looks like this.

</p>

The basic steps to select files is as follows.  (See **Next Steps** below for more ways to do it).  
- *Either* select a single folder by clicking ![Folder](Resources/icons8_Folder_16.png).  
- *Or* select a folder and sub folders by clicking ![Folders](Resources/icons8_folder_tree_16.png).  
- Populate the list by clicking ![Update](Resources/Synch_16.png) (it should be colored orange).  
- To start over, clear the list by clicking ![Remove All](Resources/icons8_trash_16.png).

The **Task Tab** looks like this.

</p>


The basic steps to configure a task are as follows.
- Click the left-most checkbox to enable a task.
- Select the desired file type(s).  These are the checkboxes to the right of the `Enable` button.  In order, they select `Assembly`, `Part`, `Sheetmetal`, and `Draft`. If a file type is not applicable for a task, its checkbox is disabled.
- If there any options, set those as desired.
- If you are unsure of what the command does, or how it works, click the right-most blue icon.  It will take you directly to the help topic for that command.

When processing is complete, if any errors are found, a log file will open showing each error and the file in which it occurred. 

You can interrupt the program before it finishes. While processing, the Cancel button changes to a Stop button.  Just click that to halt execution.  It may take several seconds to register the request.  It doesn't hurt to click it a couple of times.

Oh, one last thing.  This is not a perfect program.  It processes a large number of files in a short amount of time.  It can do damage at the same rate.  We have run it on thousands of our files, but none of yours.  *Back up any files before using it.*
