# Release Notes

Solid Edge Housekeeper is a batch utility for finding annoying little errors in your project.  It is free and open source and you can find it [<ins>**Here**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper#readme).

Please note, the program has been tested on thousands of our files, but none of yours.  Do not run it on production work without testing on backups first.

Feel free to report bugs and/or ideas for improvement on the [<ins>**Solid Edge Forum**</ins>](https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/topic/0TO4O000000MihiWAC/solid-edge) or [<ins>**GitHub**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/issues).

## V2025.4 

We'll get right to the updates, but first some exciting news -- Housekeeper has two new **Sponsors:** **Breit Ideas** and **Pelican Industries!** 

Now, on to those updates...

### Replace OLE Links

Sponsored by **Breit Ideas** and **Pelican Industries.**  Thank you!

This is an automated method to replace OLE inserted objects with SE-native blocks in draft files.  It works in conjunction with the `Run External Program` command in Housekeeper.

It's pretty general-purpose and you may be able to use it as-is.  However, if you need to tweak things, feel free.  It's open source after all.

See the [<ins>**Replace OLE Links Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/HousekeeperExternalPrograms/tree/main/ReplaceOLELinks#readme) for details.


### File List

Contributed by **@[Francesco Arfilli].**  Thank you!

#### Update file properties display

Added the ability to update the display of file properties without updating the list itself.  This can be a time saver on a large top-level assembly, or with time-consuming filter or sort options.  To do so, hold down the `Shift` key and click the `Update` button.

#### Shortcut menu

Added `Select all` and `Copy` to the menu.  The former selects all items on the list.  The latter copies selected items to the clipboard.  Column headers are not copied.  

This can be handy when you need to quickly copy list items into Excel for further processing or sharing with others.  Combined with Housekeeper's extensive filtering and sorting capabilities this can be a powerful and flexible way to extract and convey information.

#### List processing

Changed the presentation of files imported from a list.  Now missing files are added to the `Excluded files` group.  Previously they were ignored.

Fixed an issue where comma characters in a file name or directory caused it to be ignored.

See the [<ins>**File Selection Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/blob/master/HelpTopics.md#selection) for details.


### Other

- Added the ability to print custom size drawing sheets (Thank you **@ih0nza!**).  On the `Sheet Selector` dialog, click `Show all sheets` and select `CustomSheetSize`.  In the table that appears, enter the range of sheet sizes to accept.

- Added the ability to rename a variable with the `Edit variables` command (Thank you **@[Francesco Arfilli]!**).

- Added an option, `Allow partial success` to the `Break Links` command (Thank you **john.matthews3452!**).  Previously any error caused the file to not be saved.

- Fixed an issue with `Update Drawing Styles from Template` where Table text was not updated correctly (Thank you **@robbin70!**).  Changed the processing order so that dependent objects are now processed after their dependencies.

- Fixed an issue with `Add from Team Center` where the `ItemID` variable name was hard-coded in the program (Thank you **@sjim99!**).  It is now entered by the user on the Settings page.

- Fixed a regression with Set Document Status (Thank you **@TeeVar!**).

- Fixed a regression adding a new property with the `Edit Properties` command (Thank you **@[Robin BIomberg]** and **@Monostre!**)



## V2025.3 Enhancements/Fixes

### Update Blocks

Sponsored by **@john.matthews3452 (Hatch)**. Thank you!

Added a new command to replace, add, and/or delete drawing sheet blocks.  

![Update Blocks](My%20Project/media/task_update_blocks.png)

The block library, probably just your Draft template, is the source for new or replacement blocks.  Drop downs are automatically populated with the library contents.  Blocks in the files but not in the library can be added manually.  There are options for handling name conflicts.

When adding a block, the program checks each sheet of the library and places an occurrence on the corresponding sheet of the file.  It is placed at the same location, with the same scale and rotation, as the original.  If the file does not have a corresponding sheet, it can optionally be reported in the log file.

See the [<ins>**Update Blocks Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/blob/master/HelpTopics.md#update-blocks) for details.

### Save Drawing As

Contributed by **@Francesco Arfilli**.  Thank you!

Added the ability to create filenames and subdirectory formulas using the Expression Editor.  This can be especially handy if you need to use an `If` statement to decide where to save a file.

![Expression Editor](My%20Project/media/release_notes_task_save_drawing_as.png)

Added the same functionality to `Save Model As`.

See the [<ins>**Save Model As Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/blob/master/HelpTopics.md#save-model-as) for details.

### Expression Editor

Added the ability to use `VB` as the programming language in the editor.  Previously, only `NCalc` was available.  

![Expression Editor](My%20Project/media/expression_editor.png)

`VB` is a full-featured programming language.  If a job can be done with a program, chances are it can be done with `VB`.  For many, it is also more readable, flexible, and familiar than other choices.

See the [<ins>**Edit Properties Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/blob/master/HelpTopics.md#edit-properties) for details.

### Run External Program

Added a code snippet example (contributed by **@ih0nza**.  Thank you!)  The program toggles assembly preview off and on, saving the file each time.  It is meant to improve loading times.  [<ins>**Check it out!**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/HousekeeperExternalPrograms/blob/main/Snippets/SaveAndTogglePreviewGeometry.snp)

![Run External Program](My%20Project/media/task_run_external_program.png)

Added an option to hide the popup window of the external program (Thank you **@[Robin BIoomberg]!**)  This keeps you from being interrupted every few seconds while trying to get other work done.

Added a code snippet example to update the properties of a parts list from another entry in `DraftList.txt`.  (Thank you again **@[Robin BIoomberg]!**)  

Added the ability to refer to Solid Edge type libraries in code snippets (Thank you **@artem1t**!).  Previously, only Visual Basic types were recognized.

Added an option to delete temp files created by the snippet functionality.  Normally you want this enabled, but can disable it if you need to inspect the `*.ps1` file created by the command for any reason.

See the [<ins>**Run External Program Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/blob/master/HelpTopics.md#run-external-program) for details.

Also see the [<ins>**Housekeeper External Programs Snippets Section**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/HousekeeperExternalPrograms/tree/main/Snippets) for examples.


### File List

Contributed by **@Francesco Arfilli**.  Thank you!

Fixed an issue where properties on the list were not being shown for read-only files.  (Thank you **@ih0nza!**)

Fixed an issue where directories with commas were causing some input sources to return no results.  (Thank you **@collands!**)

Fixed an issue where a server query was not returning results when the query contained a property formula.

Added a warning for `Move to Recycle Bin` for network files where the server may not have a recycle bin.

Added a reminder to update the file list if any changes to the input list is made.  This is for new or infrequent users.  It's very annoying.  Turn it off on the **Configuration Tab -- General Page**.

See the [<ins>**File List Options Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/blob/master/HelpTopics.md#file-list-options) for details.

### Break Links

Added an option to break block symbol links (Thank you **@john.matthews3452!**)

### Open Draft Files Inactive

Added an option to open draft files in inactive mode.  (Thank you **@ih0nza!**)  It is meant to speed up processing of large assembly drawings.

Not all commands that process drawings are compatible with this option.  If there is a conflict, it is reported to the user before processing begins.

See the [<ins>**Configuration Tab -- General Page**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/blob/master/HelpTopics.md#general-page) for details.

### Other

#### Housekeeper Not Starting

Solution contributed by **@Francesco Arfilli**.  Thank you!

From a bug report on Github (Thank you **@DieCola85!**), Francesco figured out the user's COM objects had become unregistered.  He suggested re-running the most recent MP and that fixed it!

#### Run in Background

Added a command compatability check for background processing.  (Thank you **@DieCola85!**)

#### Update Model/Drawing from Template

Fixed an issue with counter drill feature callouts on earlier versions of Solid Edge (Thank you **@TeeVar**!).

Improved error reporting of object property assignments.

#### Presets

Added an option to ignore file filter settings when saving a Preset.  (Thank you **@ih0nza!**)  This can avoid an unnecessary update to the file list in certain situations.  Set it on the new **Presets Options Page**.

#### Edit Properties

Improved error reporting for malformed `Find` and `Replace` strings.  (Thank you **@robbin70!**)

Fixed an issue where some date properties we not found when using the option `Run Task without Solid Edge`.  (Thank you **@Francesco Arfilli!**)

#### Create Flat Pattern (Housekeeper External Program)

Fixed an issue where the cut size variables were not set. (Thank you again **@robbin70!**) 

#### Update Model Size in Variable Table

Fixed an issue where existing variables were not updated.  (Thank you yet again **@robbin70!**)

#### Use Existing Solid Edge Session (if any)

Fixed an issue where user messages were not re-enabled after processing.  (Thank you one more time **@robbin70!**)

#### Update Part Copies

Added `*.asm` files as a valid part copy source.  (Thank you **@sven-11111!**)  Previously, only `*.par` and `*.psm` files were allowed.

Added document type to the reporting of unrecognized file types.  Previously only the task name was logged.

#### Print Task

Added an option to print drawings with custom sheet sizes.  (Thank you **@ih0nza!**)

## V2025.2 Enhancements/Fixes

We'll get to the highlights in just a second, but first some big news...  Housekeeper has its first **Sponsor!**  

Our very own **@john.matthews3452**, and his employer **Hatch**, brought on our very own **@aalian.khan8036** (our newest **Contributor**) as a CoOp student to integrate TeamCenter into the program.  It's a capability that many have asked for.  Can't wait for you to see their handywork!

Oh, and if you like stats...  The program has over **2100 downloads** (almost 1000 in the last year), **6 contributors** (5 really, but I count **Francesco** twice!), **36 releases**, and more than **1000 commits** and **100 closed Issues** on GitHub.  Thanks to everyone for spreading the word!

Now on to those highlights...

### TeamCenter Integration

Sponsored by **@john.matthews3452 (Hatch)**. Thank you!

Contributed by **@aalian.khan8036** (with helpful guidance from **@SatyenB**). Thank you!

Added the ability to select files from TeamCenter.  

![Selection Toolbar](My%20Project/media/selection_toolbar.png)

Clicking ![TeamCenter Icon](Resources/teamcenter.png) opens the form.

![Add Teamcenter Items](My%20Project/media/add_teamcenter_items.png)

You search by Item ID and Revision, pasting from Excel if desired.  Prompts for a login if required.  If the Revision field is blank, it returns the most recent.  You can filter by file type.  You can add all files, or select from the list. 

The files are downloaded to your cache if necessary, then copied into Housekeeper's file list.  

See the [<ins>**Select from TeamCenter Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/blob/master/HelpTopics.md#select-from-teamcenter) for details.

### Check Drawings

Added checks for overridden or hidden dimension values, and for drawing views that have been modified with the Draw In View command.

See the [<ins>**Check Drawing Views Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/blob/master/HelpTopics.md#check-drawings) for details.

### Check Filename

Renamed the command `Check part number does not match filename` to `Check filename`.

- Added the option to use a property formula.  Previously only a single property was allowed.  (Thank you **@tempod!**).
- Added a choice of comparison operators: `contains` or `is_exactly`.
- Clarified the description of the sometimes confusing option `Draft files -- Check the draft file itself`.
- Updated the documentation to show examples for common use cases.

See the [<ins>**Check Filename Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/blob/master/HelpTopics.md#check-filename) for details.


### Check Relationships

Added the ability to detect suppressed occurrences in assemblies.  (Thank you **@GregL!** and **@javigoca!**)

See the [<ins>**Check Relationships Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/blob/master/HelpTopics.md#check-relationships) for details.

### Run External Program

Added the ability to run a user-supplied `code snippet`.  The program inserts the snippet between two sections of pre-built code that take care of the task's set-up and wrap-up, respectively.  The code snippet is the (often very short) part that does the actual task at hand. It's just a text file in VB.Net syntax.  You can create it in Notepad.

The intent is to address one-off automation chores, where the time to do the job manually can't justify the time needed to write, test and maintain a separate program to do it automatically.  Here's an example.  (Note, the variables `DocType`, `SEDoc`, etc. are predefined in the set-up code and available for use.)

```
If DocType = ".asm" Then SEDoc.PhysicalProperties.UpdateOnFileSaveStatus = True
If DocType = ".par" Then SEDoc.UpdateOnFileSave = True
If DocType = ".psm" Then SEDoc.UpdateOnFileSave = True
If DocType = ".dft" Then ExitStatus = 1
If ExitStatus = 0 Then
    SEDoc.Save()
    SEApp.DoIdle()
Else
    ErrorMessageList.Add("An error occurred")
End If
```

You can see some examples in the [<ins>Code Snippet</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/HousekeeperExternalPrograms/tree/main/Snippets) section of the [<ins>Housekeeper External Programs</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/HousekeeperExternalPrograms#readme) repository.  That repo also has two new programs you can try -- [<ins>Thin Part to Sheetmetal</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/HousekeeperExternalPrograms/tree/main/ThinPartToSheetmetal) and [<ins>Create Flat Pattern</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/HousekeeperExternalPrograms/tree/main/CreateFlatPattern).

See the [<ins>**Run External Program Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/blob/master/HelpTopics.md#run-external-program) for details.

### Batch Importer

Added a new bare-bones batch importer.  This is a separate program and not part of Housekeeper.

The first time the program runs, it creates a file, `program_settings.txt`, in the same directory as the executable.  That is where you specify the template to use for the conversion, the type of file to import, and the input and output directories.

See the [<ins>**Batch Importer Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/BatchImporter#readme) for details.

### Structured Storage

Fixed an issue where weldment materials were not processed correctly.

Fixed an issue where certain missing links were not captured.

### Other

Fixed an issue where the `List update frequency` and several other variables were not properly initialized the first time running the program.  (Thank you **@64Pacific!** and **@john.matthews3452!**)

Fixed an issue in Top Level Assembly Search where in certain cases folders could be searched more than once.

## V2025.1 Enhancements/Fixes

### Presets

Presets are a way to capture any setup changes you make in the course of using the program.  (Thank you **@Francesco Arfilli**, **@mmtrebuchet**, and others!)

![Tabs](My%20Project/media/presets.png)

Presets help you perform recurring tasks you encounter as part of your job.  An example might be releasing a project.  You probably need to make sure files are up to date, parts have drawings, output files have been generated, etc., etc.  Each step takes a certain amount of setup, for example configuring a property filter, selecting tasks, tweaking options, and so on. 

Using Presets, you can capture that work one time.  The next time it comes up, choose the appropriate Preset and you're ready to go.  It saves a bit of time, but more importantly it can cut down on costly mistakes and delays.

See the [<ins>**Presets Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/#presets) for details.

### File List
Contributed by **@Francesco Arfilli**.  Thank you!

#### List Customization

- File properties can now be displayed on the list.  (Thank you **@CareFrame1**!)
- Properties can be edited and changed in place.  
- The list can be sorted by column.  
- The list can be saved in CSV format.  (Thank you again **@CareFrame1**!)
- File groups are collapsible.
- File grouping is optional.

![Insert Property](My%20Project/media/file_list_properties.png)

#### New Input Source

Added a new input source, `Individual Files`, to the file selection options.  This can be a time saver if you are faced with a large directory listing and already know the file's name.  Simply start typing the name in the dialog's text box and it will automatically filter the list for you.  You can also select multiple files at a time with this option.

![Insert Property](My%20Project/media/file_list_individual_files.png)

#### Select Multiple Folders
As with the `Individual Files` above, added multi-select to `Folder`, `Folder with subfolders`, and `Top level assembly folder`.

#### User Feedback

If any files on the list are *selected*, the program assumes those are the only ones to be processed.  This can be confusing/annoying.  To alert the user, the process button text now changes from **Process** to **Process Selected**.  (Thank you **@64Pacific**!)

Added dates and sizes to each listed file's tooltip popup.

#### New Shortcut Command

Added `Move to Recycle Bin` to the shortcut menu.  This is kinda asking for trouble, but can be handy with the top-level assembly `Report unrelated files` option.  Follow the help topic link below for some tips on how it can be used safely.

#### Read-Only Directories

Fixed an issue where encountering a read-only directory was keeping a `Folders with subfolders` search from processing to completion.

See the [<ins>**File List Options Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/#file-list-options) for details.

### File Server Query
Contributed by **@Francesco Arfilli**.  Thank you!

Added the ability to query a server to access properties.

![Insert Property](My%20Project/media/server_query.png)

I'd say more about this, but honestly I'm kinda afraid of servers, and especially SQL.  If this looks useful, you already know way more about it than I do.

See the [<ins>**Server Query Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/#server-query-page) for details.

### Property Selection

Added processing of localized property names where applicable.

Expanded the ability to select properties, either from a drop down or shortcut menu, in all locations where properties can be used.  Previously, that was only available with `Property Filter` and `Edit Properties`.

Added support for all property variable types.  Previously, only text type properties were processed. (Thank you **@Francesco Arfilli**!)

In the `Edit Variables` command, added the ability to use a property in the `Number/Formula` field.


See the [<ins>**Templates Page Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/#templates-page) and [<ins>**Edit Variables Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/#edit-variables) for details.

### Set Document Status

Added a new Task to set document status.  (Thank you **@Francesco Arfilli**!)

![Insert Property](My%20Project/media/task_set_document_status.png)

Since a file can become read-only with certain status changes, the command runs outside of Solid Edge.  Because it uses Microsoft's Structured Storage, it is 100x to 400x faster than Solid Edge.

The previous capability `Process as Available` can still be used.  With it, you have the option to revert the file to the previous status after processing.  Note, to avoid confusion only one status-changing operation can be used at a time.

See the [<ins>**Set Document Status Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/#set-document-status) for details.

### Update Material from Material Table

Added an option to update face styles using a part's finish property, rather than the material itself. (Thank you **@KGeetings**!)

A face style with the same name as the finish must be present in the file. Finishes that do not change the appearance of the part, such as `NONE` or `CLEAR ANODIZE` can be excluded from processing.  Enter the names on the list provided.

See the [<ins>**Update Material from Material Table Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/#update-material-from-material-table) for details.

### Check Links

Added an option to run this command without Solid Edge.  As with `Set Document Status`, it uses Microsoft's Structured Storage with equivalent speed increases.

Added the same option to `Part Number Does Not Match Filename`, `Missing Drawing`, and `Material Not In Material Table`.

See the [<ins>**Check Links Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/#check-links) for details.

### Save Model As

Added the ability to change the file name itself when saving.  (Thank you **@pkoevesdi**, **@Jojo15702**, **@ih0nza**!)

The name can be drawn from one or more properties in the file.  As with the subdirectory feature, if the property contains any characters that are not valid in file names, they are replaced using the `filename_charmap.txt` lookup table.

Added the ability to save Solid Edge Viewer files, `*.sev`.  (Thank you **@mefrebo**!)

Made the same changes to `Save Drawing As`.

See the [<ins>**Save Model As Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/#save-model-as) for details.

### Top Level Assembly

Replaced DesignManager with RevisionManager for users running older versions of Solid Edge where the former is not available. (Thank you **@Francesco Arfilli**!)

Replaced DesignManager with Structured Storage for top-down searches for all versions.

Fixed an issue where Family of Parts Masters (and all their links) were included in top-down searches.  (Thank you again **@Francesco Arfilli**!)

Fixed an issue where a model file contained in a drawing, but not otherwise related to the top level assembly, was not included in search results.

Fixed an issue, with multiple top-level directories, where nested directories were being processed twice.

### Other

Added a startup splash screen for monitoring program initialization.  Pay attention, there's a fun little animation at the end!

Added a `Keep duplicates` option for the Sort Order `None`.  (Thank you **@mefrebo**!)

Added a parameter, `Update the file list after this many files`, to the **Configuration Tab -- General Page**.  The default, `1`, is usually a good choice.  It can be increased for Structured Storage mode, where updating the list is sometimes the most time-consuming part.

Fixed an issue where the `Print Task` `Sheet Selector` was not filtering ISO sheet sizes correctly.

Added collapsible sections to the Readme to improve navigation. (Thank you **@Francesco Arfilli**!)

Removed program dependencies on some outdated packages.

## V2024.3 Enhancements/Fixes

We'll get to the highlights in just a second, but first some big news...  Housekeeper has two new contributors!  Our very own **@ChrisNC** (github @ChrisClems) and **@ZaPpInG** (github @lrmoreno007).  Can't wait for you to see their handywork!

Also, a big shout out to our **Beta Testers**!  With their help, we fixed several bugs, streamlined inputs, added command options, clarified documentation, and pushed a dozen commits to GitHub.  Thank you!

Now to the highlights...

### New Task Page
Concept by **@Francesco Arfilli** Thank you!

He's at it *again*!  More streamlined, better organized, and more colorful than ever!  Consolided four tabs into one.  Placed all options at your fingertips.  Dramatically reduced clutter.  You're going to love it!

<p align="center">
  <img src="My%20Project/media/sheetmetal_done.png">
</p>

See the little blue icons everywhere?  Those are context-sensitive help buttons.  Click one and see what happens! 

Oh, and he wasn't done!  You can even *customize* the list.  Rearrange tasks according to how you work.  Remove ones you don't use.  Change colors to your preference.  Change the names of any or all -- even in your own language if you want.

Those things are all great, but the biggest improvement is the ability to add copies of any task to the list.  Each copy is separately configurable.  With this you can, for example:

- Create a second `Print` command and configure it to send large sheets to the plotter (Thank you **@n0minus38**!).  
- Add multiple `Update drawings from template` tasks, so each of your clients get their own custom drawing border.
- Put in another `Save As` so you can generate `*.stp` and `*.jt` files in one pass (Thank you **@Robin BIoemberg**!).

<p align="center">
  <img src="My%20Project/media/edit_task_list.png">
</p>

See the [<ins>**Task Tab Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/#task-tab) for details.


### Edit Properties
Contributed by **@Francesco Arfilli** Thank you!

He *still* wasn't done!  For this release, Francesco implemented a new Expression Editor for more complex find/replace jobs.  He also added an option to edit properties without opening Solid Edge.

#### Expression Editor

An `expression` is similar to a `formula` in Excel. You can perform string processing, create logical expressions, do arithmetic, and, well, almost anything.  You can test your expression interactively. You can save it for reuse.

![Expression Editor](My%20Project/media/expression_editor.png)

#### Direct Edit

This is *blazingly* fast.  It can run a monster batch of parts before Solid Edge even gets its shoes on!  It leverages something called Windows Structured Storage (Thank you **@uk_dave_official**!).  It's experimental for now, but if you get a chance, try it out and let us know what you think!

Oh, did I mention you don't need Solid Edge installed to use this?  Maybe *you-know-who* in Purchasing could get in on the fun for a change!

#### Selecting Properties

Prior to this version, properties had to be typed in manually.  Now they are read from your templates.  Click `Update` on the **Configuration Tab -- Templates Page** to populate the list.  To add a property not present in your template, right-click the Selected Properties list and choose `Add property manually`.

![Expression Editor](My%20Project/media/customize_property_list.png)

The properties are selected from a drop down in the `Property Filter` and `Edit Properties` dialogs.  If either of these commands is started and the property list was not populated, an error message is displayed.

In places where property substitution is allowed, like the  `Find` and `Replace` text in `Edit Properties` or subdirectory formula in `Save As`, they are accessed via shortcut menu which brings up the following dialog.

![Insert Property](My%20Project/media/property_selector.png)

#### Family of Assemblies

Fixed an issue where Family of Assemblies were not processed.  (Thank you **@64Pacific**!)  

A recent update to Solid Edge now allows each family member to have its own properties.  This command only works on the base file.  It checks if the `Apply edits to all members` flag is set.  If not, it reports an error.

See the [<ins>**Edit Properties Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/#edit-properties) for details.


### Update Flat Pattern
Contributed by **@ChrisNC** Thank you!

I don't know how I didn't think of this before.  Luckily Chris did!

Before updating the flat pattern, this command first regenerates the flat *model*.  That is the parent geometry of the flat pattern.  If you have an automated model-to-laser workflow, you may have noticed that sometimes exported files contain no geometry.  This is a fix for that situation.

See the [<ins>**Update Flat Pattern Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/#update-flat-pattern) for details.

### Break Links
Contributed by **@ChrisNC** Thank you!

This command removes external links from a file.  You can optionally remove `Part Copy` design and construction links, `Excel` variable and dimension formula links, `Draft model` drawing view links (Thank you **@BrianVR74**!), or `All interpart` links.

This is irreversible, so you know, think about it.  

For drawing views in particular, there are important things to know about model properties (like ones maybe driving your title block, for example).  Please visit the link for information on that.

See the [<ins>**Break Links Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/#break-links) for details.

### Create drawing of flat pattern
Contributed by **@ChrisNC** Thank you!

Creates a `*.dft` or `*.pdf` of a flat pattern using the template you specify.  The drawing is centered, with optional offsets, on the sheet; it is scaled and rotated to fit the available space.  You can save the drawing in the original directory, or in another you specify.

See the [<ins>**Create Drawing of Flat Pattern Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/#create-drawing-of-flat-pattern) for details.

### Recognize Holes
Contributed by **@ZaPpInG** Thank you!

Have you ever had the feeling that if you do this tiresome, repetetive thing one more time you are going to *scream*?!

Our newest contributor did, and he did something about it.  He taught himself VB.net and the Solid Edge API (in *two weeks*!!) to automate just such a job.

The job is to recognize holes in freshly imported parts.  He has tentative plans to add more capability.  Stay tuned!

See the [<ins>**Recognize Holes Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/#recognize-holes) for details.

### Edit Interactively

Added options to use a countdown timer and/or start a command.

![Edit Interactively](My%20Project/media/edit_interactively_release_notes.png)

The countdown timer is handy if you need to quickly review a bunch of files.  If something catches your eye, you can pause to investigate.  You don't have to wait for the timer to complete.  Just click one of the buttons at the bottom of the dialog to move on to the next file.

The start command option launches a command when the file is opened.  This can help keep you on track when you have a small chore to complete on a bunch of files.  A couple of examples:

- Enable the `Update file on save` option on the `Physical Properties` dialog (Thank you **@Jan Bos** and **@BrianVR74**!). 
- Cycle through assembly `display configurations` to make sure they are all up to date.

The list has commands we though might be useful.  You can customize it.  There are hundreds of commands available.  Customization is covered in the command's help page. 

I can't envision a case where you would use both options at the same time, but there's nothing to keep you from trying it.

See the [<ins>**Edit Interactively Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/#edit-interactively) for details.

### Property Filter

Revamped the user interface to be easier to use.  As noted earlier, properties are now selected from a drop down.  By default only the Favorite Properties are listed.  To see all of them, enable the `Show All Props` option.

![Property Filter](My%20Project/media/property_filter.png)

The saved settings were previously stored in `*.txt` format.  Thye are now saved as a `*.json` file.  These are not compatible unfortunately, so any previously saved settings will have to be recreated.

#### Property Formula

One other change was made to the `Property Filter` command -- the `formula` (a boolean expression) is now evaluated internally with `PowerShell`, replacing the not-long-for-this-world `VBScript`.  In theory that should not cause any problems because it is a core Windows feature (starting with Win7 maybe, not sure).  

However, if it doesn't work for you, please let me know.  I have a couple of other ideas where that program could come in handy.  If it's going to cause headaches I'll go a different direction.

See the [<ins>**Property Filter Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper#filtering) for details.

### Quick Start Guide

Added a guide for new and infrequent users.  (Thank you **@gir.isi**, **@BrianVR74**, **@Amial_From_France** and many others!)  It's not nearly as detailed as the README, but it will get you up and running much more quickly.

View the [<ins>**Quick Start Guide**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/blob/master/quick_start_guide.md).


### Check Relationships

Consolidated several commands into one.  Each is now presented as a separate option.

![Check Relationships](My%20Project/media/task_check_relationships.png)

Several other commands were similarly consolidated, `Check drawings` and `Update drawing styles from template`, for example.

See the [<ins>**Check Relationships Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/#check-relationships) for details.

### Update Model Styles from Template

Fixed an issue where only face styles and the active view style were updated.  Now all styles are updated (Thank you **@tempod**!).  As before, the view style active in the template becomes the view style active in the model.

Any style in the template, but not in the model, is added.  Any in the model, but not the template, are optionally deleted if possible.  It is not possible to remove ones Solid Edge thinks are in use (even if they aren't). 

See the [<ins>**Update Model Styles from Template Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/#update-model-styles-from-template) for details.

### Save Model As

Added an option, for image files, to change the view style before saving.  (Thank you **@tempod**!)

Added the ability, when saving to the original directory, to specify a subdirectory.  (Thank you **@[Robin BIoemberg]**!)   This feature was also added to the `Save Drawing As` command.

See the [<ins>**Save Model As Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/#save-model-as) for details.

### New Version Check

Added an option to automatically check for updates on GitHub.  If a newer version is found, a dialog informs you.  It also provides links to the release notes, installation instructions, and download page.  

The option is disabled by default.  Enable it on the **Configuration Tab -- General Page**.

### Use Existing Solid Edge Session

Contributed by **@Francesco Arfilli**  Thank you!

Added an option, on the **Configuration Tab -- General Page**, to run Housekeeper with an already-open SE instance.  Previously, SE had to be closed before starting the program.

The previous behavior was to protect you from crashes, causing any unsaved work to be lost.  That can still happen, but it's less frequent now.  One sure way to crash SE is to try to open a corrupted file, or one saved in a newer version, or one from Academic/Community/Commercial flavor if you're not running the same.

If you're pretty sure you won't run into that, this is a handy option.  It won't hurt my feelings if you save your work before starting.

### Readme

Changed the context-sensitive help to point to a version-specific Readme file in the repo.  This addresses an issue where, because the documentation is auto-generated, the Readme "gets ahead" of the currently released version. 

If you're a URL checker like me, you might notice the link is pointing to a pretty funky address, for example:

https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper/tree/dd8c4f99b824f1e94c7799fa3cb5a7db8fd2c640#open-save

That long string of seemingly random numbers is the `Git Commit Hash`.  It is the mechanism used to tell GitHub to open a file as it appeared at a certain point in the past.

In addition to the new context-sensitive help, also added a table of contents to improve navigation of the documentation.  Links to all major topics are provided.  More complex sections, such as Property Filtering, have their own supplemental table of contents.

## V2024.1 Enhancements/Fixes

### Variables Edit/Add/Expose

(Thank you **@Bert303**!)

Added the ability to change and/or expose variables. Variables can optionally be added. The option is set on the **Configuration Tab -- General Page**. Multiple variables can be processed at a time. This is an extension of the previous `Expose Variables` command, which has now been removed.

![Variable Input Form](My%20Project/media/variable_input_editor.png)

The variables are processed in the order shown on the form. They can be moved up or down, or deleted, using the buttons provided.

The settings from one tab can be copied to others, using the `Copy To` CheckBoxes as desired.

### Copy Model Size to the Variable Table

(Thank you **@Imre Szucs**, **@64Pacific**!)

Added the ability to copy the model size to the variable table. This is primarily intended for standard cross-section material (barstock, channel, etc.), but can be used for any purpose. The variables are exposed so they can be used in a callout, parts list, or the like. 

![Overall Size Options](My%20Project/media/overall_size_options.png)

See the [<ins>**Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper#copy-overall-size-to-variable-table) for details.

### Process files with any Document Status

(Thank you **@jnewell**, **@Robin BIoemberg**!)

Added the ability to process files regardless of Document Status. After processing, the file can be reverted back to the old Status, or changed to a new one.  These options are set on the **Configuration Tab -- Open/Save Page**.

![Open/Save](My%20Project/media/file_open_save_options.png)

### Save As

(Thank you **@roger.ribamatic**, **@SatyenB**, **@Robin BIoemberg**!)

Added a new file type, `PDF per Sheet` for drawings.  The output file name is of the format `<Filename>-<Sheetname>.pdf`. There is an option to suppress the `Sheetname` suffix on drawings with only one sheet. The option is on the **Configuration Tab -- Open/Save Page**.

Added new file type `*.jt` for model files.

### Draft Print

(Thank you **@n0minus38**!)

Added an optional second printer for selected sheet sizes. (By disabling the default `Printer1`, you can print *only* selected sizes.)

![Configuration](My%20Project/media/printer_setup.png)

Changed how a printer is selected.  It is now from a pre-populated list of installed printers. Previously it was from the Windows Print dialog.  This was confusing because clicking OK implied a document would be printed.

Removed some other confusing control options.

### Configuration Tab

(Thank you **@Francesco Arfilli**!)

Converted to a tab-page layout for easier navigation. 

![Configuration](My%20Project/media/top_level_assy_options.png)

### Compare Model and Flat Pattern Model Volumes

Contributed by our very own **o_o ....码**.  Thank you!

A Housekeeper External Program that computes the difference in volume of a bent sheetmetal part and its flat pattern.

The program addresses an issue where a flat pattern is created in the Synchronous environment.  If Ordered features are then added, they are not always carried over to the flat pattern. Compounding the problem, even though it is out-of-date, the flat pattern is not flagged as such.

Please visit the [<ins>**Readme**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/HousekeeperExternalPrograms/tree/main/CompareFlatAndModelVolumes#readme)  page for more details.

### Property Find/Replace

Add the ability to change multiple properties at a time. A dialog similar to the new Variable Input Editor is provided.

![Property Input Editor](My%20Project/media/property_input_editor.png)

See the [<ins>**Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper#property-find-replace) for details.

### Update Physical Properties

Added the ability to update `mass`, `volume`, etc. for model files. Models with `density = 0` are reported in the log file. 

See the [<ins>**Help Topic**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper#update-physical-properties) for details.

### Check interference

Added the ability to perform an interference check on assemblies.  All parts are checked against all others. This can take a long time on large assemblies, so there is a limit to the number of parts to check. Set it on the **Configuration Tab -- General Page**.

### Most Recently Used File List (MRU)

(Thank you **@Francesco Arfilli**!)

Added an option to not add files processed by Housekeeper to the MRU.

### Property Filter

Added an option to not check for properties of the models contained in Draft files.  Previous behavior was to always check.  Set the option on the **Configuration Tab -- General Page**.

Since Draft files often do not have properties of their own, normally this option should be enabled. Searching for Document Status is another story.  For example, with the option set, an `In Work` drawing of a `Released` part would confusingly show up in a search for `Released` files.

See the [<ins>**Property Filter**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper#1-property-filter) section, Document Status topic for details.

Fixed an issue where properties of Draft files themselves were sometimes not searched.

Fixed an issue where changing the Property Filter did not always set the File List out-of-date flag correctly.

### Draft -- Add Quantity Property

(Thank you **@Pedro0996**!)

A Housekeeper External Program that gets the total quantity of each part and subassembly in a given assembly and adds that information to the part (or subassembly) file. 

In addition to the quantity, the program also records the assembly name from which the quantity was derived. Both are added as custom properties, making them available, for example, in a Callout in Draft. 

Please visit the [<ins>**Readme**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/HousekeeperExternalPrograms/tree/main/QtyFromAssy#readme) for details.

### Draft -- Convert Drawing Views to 2D

A Housekeeper External Program sample illustrating the use of PowerShell (Thank you **JasonT**!) for the Solid Edge Housekeeper `Run External Program` task.  

The program converts drawing views to stand-alone 2D views, disconnected from the 3D model. This is irreversible, so you know, think about it. 

Please visit the [<ins>**Readme**</ins>](https://github.com/rmcanany/HousekeeperExternalPrograms/tree/main/ConvertDraftTo2D#readme) for details.

### Update Material from Material Table

Added an option to remove face style overrides.  Set the option on the **Configuration Tab -- General Page**.

### Update Drawing Views

Fixed an issue where family of assembly files were not being found. Fixed the same issue on the `Broken Links` Task.

### Housekeeper External Program AddRemoveCustomProperties

Added an option to remove all properties *except* those listed in the program settings file.

### GUI Font

(Thank you **@Francesco Arfilli**!)

Changed from `Microsoft SanSerif` (circa 1995) to the Win11 standard `Segoe UI Variable Display`. 

### Preferences Folder

Added a new location for user data.  It is now stored in the `Preferences` folder in the Housekeeper root directory. Previously it was stored in the same folder as the executable and associated files, making it hard to identify user-specific files.

### Saved Settings

Fixed an issue where a setting containing the "=" character was being truncated when read from the `defaults.txt` file.


## V2023.6 Enhancements/Fixes

### Process Tasks in Background -- Increased speed

Contributed by **@Fiorini** 
(GitHub: [**@farfilli**](https://github.com/farfilli)).  Thank you!

Uses the SolidEdgeCommunity OpenInBackground function (Thank you **@JNewell**!).  Speedup varies -- from 3X to 10X depending on the task.  The option is set on the **Configuration Tab**.

Some tasks (`Fit view`, `Interactive edit`, and `Save As`) are incompatible with background processing.  The program checks  and notifies the user of a conflict.  

At this time, assemblies still run in the old mode -- graphics hidden, not disabled.  

### Sort Order -- Random sampling

Added an option to randomly select and shuffle a fraction of the total files found.  The `Sample fraction` is a decimal number between `0.0` and `1.0`.  Sort options are set on the **Configuration Tab**.

![Logo](My%20Project/media/file_sort_options.png)

This option is primarily intended for software testing, but can be used for any purpose.

### Dependency-order Sort

Fixed an issue, in top-level search mode, where the top level assembly itself was not sorted correctly.

### Bottom Up Search 

Fixed an issue where bottom up search was not returning Family of Assemblies links.  


## V2023.5 Enhancements/Fixes

### Update Draft Styles from Template

Contributed by **@Fiorini** (GitHub: [**@farfilli**](https://github.com/farfilli)).  Thank you!

Now does an in-place update, rather than creating a new file.  

The new method preserves the file creation date, which was requested by several users.  It also reports styles and background sheets not updated because they were not found in the template.

These styles are processed: DimensionStyles, DrawingViewStyles, LinearStyles, TableStyles, TextCharStyles, TextStyles.  

These are not: DashStyles, FillStyles, HatchPatternStyles, SmartFrame2dStyles.  

The latter group encountered errors in testing.  However, the cause was not thoroughly investigated.  If you need them updated, please ask on the Forum. 

Note, the previous method (the one that creates a new file) is not exposed in the user interface, but has not been removed from the code.   If you prefer that version, please ask on the Forum.

### File List Sorting

Added sorting options of `None`, `Alphabetic`, and `Dependency` (Thank you **@HIL**). Previously the list was always sorted alphabetically.

![File list sorting options](My%20Project/media/file_sort_options.png)

The `Dependency` order is intended to help eliminate the annoying dark gray corners on drawings.  The `None` option is primarily intended to preserve the order on imported lists.

These options are set on the **Configuration Tab -- File List Group**.

### Update Part Copies

Added an option to recursively update part copies.  It is yet another technique to help eliminate gray corners on drawings.

Recursion means
that if a Part Copy is encountered, the parent file is opened. If *that* file has a Part Copy, its parent is opened in turn. The program continues in this fashion until the base file (ie one with no Part Copies) is reached. It then updates each file in reverse order.

The option is set on the **Configuration Tab -- Miscellaneous Group**.

### Property Find/Replace

Added this functionality for Draft files (Thank you **@Seva**).

Includes wildcard search, Regex processing, and Property formula substitution. For details, see the Help topic under Assembly Tasks: Property Find/Replace.

![Draft Property Find/Replace](My%20Project/media/copy_model_properties_to_draft.png)

The example shown above would populate the Draft file's Title with the Title of the model file.

### Drawing View on Background Sheet

Checks all background sheets of a Draft file for the presence of a drawing view.

### Top Level Assembly Search

Fixed an issue where a top-level search with no top-level folders resulted in no files being found (Thank you **@MonkTheOCD_Engie**)

Added the ability to report files unrelated to a top level assembly using a Bottom-Up search.  Previously only Top-Down search had this option.

### File Drag and Drop

Fixed an issue where files added by drag-and-drop were deleted from the list when running the `Update File List` command (Thank you **@HIL**).

### Save As

Added `Save Copy As` for all file types.  In the ComboBox, select the `Copy` option.  If you try to save a copy to the original folder, you will get an error.

## V2023.3 Enhancements/Fixes

### Property Find/Replace

Added Wildcard and Regular Expression search options 
(Thank you **@DaveG, @mmtrebuchet**).  Also added 
Property Formula substitution (Thank you **@64Pacific**, **@ben.steele6044**).  

![Find_Replace](My%20Project/media/property_find_replace.png)

The example above would replace anything (including nothing) 
in Custom.Engineer with "Superman".  The checkboxes set the 
search type, either Plain Text (PT), Wildcard (WC), or Regular Expression (RX).

Regular Expressions are more powerful than wildcards.  They 
are also notoriously cryptic.  To get started, check out the 
[**.NET Regex Guide**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference).

![Property Formula](My%20Project/media/property_formula.png)

The Property Formula has the same syntax as the Callout command, except 
preceeded with 'System.' or 'Custom.' as shown.  This example 
would replace anything in Custom.Description with a profile 
definition and its cut length.  (Assuming they are present in the file.)

### Property Filter

Added a regular expression comparison operator, `regex_match`.  

### Top Level Assembly Search

Added a search option for Draft files with the same name as the 
model (Thank you for input **@n0minus38, @KennyG, @Alex_H, @bshand,**
**@Nosybottle, @wku, @nate.arinta5649**).  In a test on a 
small top level assembly and a top level folder with 20k files, 
the new option completed a search in 0.3 minutes.  A top-down 
search took 11.3 minutes.  A bottom-up search (on a non-indexed 
drive) was terminated after an hour.

Fixed an issue where a Top Level search with multiple folders was 
not finding all related files (Thank you **@MonkTheOCD_Engie**).

Added a **Configuration Tab** option `Include part copies in search results`.  Disabling
the option can eliminate extraneous files from being reported in some 
cases.  (Thank you **@n0minus38**)

### File List Out Of Date

Added a flag to detect when the file list goes out of date.
It is set when any change occurs to the file selection or filter inputs.
As a visual indicator, the Update Button turns orange.

Added a check to ensure the file list is
up to date before processing can begin.

### Hide Constructions

Fixed an issue where sketches, and PMI dimensions and annotations 
were not hidden (Thank you **@tempod** (github)).

Fixed an issue where etches were being hidden.

### Update Insert Part Copies

Added PMI Update all.  Fixed an issue where PMI Update All was causing
the flat pattern to become out of date.

### Home Tab file count

Fixed an issue where the file count was incorrect for a multi-folder search.  


## V2023.1 Enhancements/Fixes

### Redesigned Home Tab

Contributed by **@Fiorini** (GitHub: [**@farfilli**](https://github.com/farfilli)).  Thank you!

The new interface is much more flexible, organized, and colorful 
than ever!  Generate your list of files from folders, sub folders, 
top-level assemblies and selected folders (Thank you **@MONKTheOCDEngie**!), 
lists, drag-and-drop, and more. 
Pick any number of each, in any combination.

If you select one or more files in the list, there's now a Shortcut Menu 
that lets you open the files in Solid Edge, view them in File Explorer, 
start processing them in Housekeeper, or exclude them from the list.

You'll also notice new icons throughout.  These are taken from standard Windows and
Solid Edge libraries and you'll recognize them instantly.  If there's one
you don't know, a tooltip pops up to tell you what it does.

**Home Tab**

### Logo

Contributed by **@daysanduski**.  Thank you!

It's at the very top of this page.  Pretty fun, huh?

### Save As

Contributed by **@Fiorini** (GitHub: [**@farfilli**](https://github.com/farfilli)).  Thank you!

Eliminate the dependency on the external program `ffmpeg.exe` for image files.

### Run external program 

Changed error handling to be more consistent with Housekeeper.

Added a new sample program to the 
[**HousekeeperExternalPrograms**](https://github.com/rmcanany/HousekeeperExternalPrograms)
repo.  

The program, `ChangeToInchAndSaveAsFlatDXF.vbs`, 
is a more complete VBScript example. 

It shows how to return an `ExitCode`,
handle `error messages` and parse the `defaults.txt` file. 
It sets off space for user code and shows how to do error handling. 
Practically every line has comments describing what it does.

At the bottom of the file are helpful links to get you started
writing your own VBScript files, using nothing more than a text editor! 
(Thank you again **@[Derek G]**!)

### Top-Level Assembly

Improved file link traversal performance in Bottom Up mode
approx 10X (Thank you **@Fiorini**).
Unfortunately, *Where Used* performance is not affected.


### Version numbers

Changed to a year-based numbering scheme (Thank you **@bshand**!).

Updated the program title bar so you
can easily check which version you are running.

![Table of Contents](My%20Project/media/tabs.png)

### Help Tab

Renamed from Readme to 
[**Help**](https://github.com/rmcanany/SolidEdgeHousekeeper#readme). 
Now hosted on GitHub, it features a more legible (and bigger) font 
and lots of pictures (Thank you **@Fiorini**!). 

For quick navigation, it also features a built in Table of Contents. 
(It's the icon next to **README.md** shown in the image below.)

![Table of Contents](My%20Project/media/table_of_contents.png)

Also updated and expanded the File Selection and Filtering Sections. 
Added sections on Collaborators, User Feedback, and Helping Out. 

### Beta Program

Implemented a way for volunteers to contribute to Housekeeper 
by testing the program before an upcoming release. 

For this round, we had four volunteers:
@n0minus38, @JayJay101, @Cimarian_RMP, and @xenia.turon.
Thank you one and all!

Because of their work, we made fifteen new commits to the master branch,
fixed six bugs, improved the documentation, 
and tested two release candidates. 

You're welcome to join us for the next release! 
Beta testing is nothing more than conducting 
your own workflow on your own files and telling me if you run into problems. 
It isn't meant to be a lot of work. 
The big idea is to make the program better for you and me and everyone else!

To sign up message me, RobertMcAnany, on the 
[**Solid Edge Forum**](https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/topic/0TO4O000000MihiWAC/solid-edge).

### ToyProject

Created a repo called [**ToyProject**](https://github.com/rmcanany/ToyProject) 
for anyone who wants to get started collaborating on Housekeeper. It has links to 
GitHub's own guides, as well as detailed instructions on how to make your first
contribution!

## v0.1.10.3 Enhancements/Fixes

### Save as

Fixed an issue with `Use subdirectory formula` when the file contains properties with no assigned name (Thank you @n0minus38).  Applied the same fix to `Property find/replace`.

Fixed another issue with `Use subdirectory formula` when the formula contains illegal characters for the file system.  (Thank you again @n0minus38).  See details on the Readme Tab, `Assembly Save As` section.

### README

In the GETTING HELP section, added instructions on how to subscribe to update notifications and/or become a beta tester.

In the INSTALLATION section, added instructions on how to copy settings files from an earlier release to a new one.



## v0.1.10 Enhancements/Fixes

### Run external program 

Added the ability to run VBScript files (Thank you @Derek G).  These are simple text files that do not require the user to install/learn Visual Studio.

Added an option to automatically save the file after the macro runs (Thank you @Chris42).  This opens up the use of `Run external program` to many macros that were not designed with Housekeeper in mind.

Added new sample code to the HousekeeperExternalPrograms repo.  https://github.com/rmcanany/HousekeeperExternalPrograms

-- BreakExcelLinks and AssemblyReport shows two examples of VBScript code (Thank you @Derek G, @wku).

-- FitIsoView shows how to parse Housekeeper's `defaults.txt` file.


### Disable graphics display  

Added an option to not display graphics during processing (Thank you @Jason1607436093479).  Speed up is approximately 2X.  One possible drawback is you don't look nearly as busy when your boss walks up and sees you playing on your phone.


### Expose variables & Expose variable missing 

Added the ability to 'expose' entries in the variable table (Thank you @MonkTheOCDEngie).  Also added a check for variable presence.  The variables are entered in a comma-delimited list on each task tab, e.g., `Flat_Pattern_Model_CutSizeX, Flat_Pattern_Model_CutSizeY, Mass`.


### Parts list missing

Added a task to check for the presence of a parts list in a Draft file.


### Save as

Added an output directory option, `Use subdirectory formula` (Thank you @SeanCresswell).  The formula is a combination of free text and variable names.  The variable name format is similar to Property Text in a Callout, for example `LASER_%{System.Material}_%{Custom.Material Thickness}`.  For more information, in particular for Draft files, see the Readme for `Save As`.

Added `.png` as an output format.  Since Solid Edge does not support it (as of SE2021), the file is first saved as a `.jpg`, then converted.  The converter is the open source image utility `ffmpeg`, which is included with Housekeeper.  You can read more about it here: https://ffmpeg.org/about.html

Added an option, `Save as image -- Crop to model size`.  The output is saved with the aspect ratio of the model, rather than the window.  The option is found on the Configuration tab.

Combined the three versions of `Save As Sheetmetal` into one.  The previous functionality is covered by two new file output options, `DXF Flat (*.dxf)` and `PDF Drawing (*.pdf)`.



### Update styles from template 

Renamed from the confusing `Move drawing to new template`.  Note, the name has changed, but the program still moves everything from the old file to a new one created using the template specified on the Configuration tab.

Fixed an issue where dimensions were copied to the working sheet from section and detail views (Thank you @Bob Henry, @MonkTheOCDEngie).

Fixed an issue where compound weld symbols did not transfer correctly (Thank you @Bob Henry).


### Property filter

Added `>` and `<` to the comparison choices.  These are mainly intended for dates and numbers (see next), but can be used for any property.

Enhanced the handling of dates and numbers by attempting to convert them into their native formats.  Previously they were treated as text.  Note this is somewhat experimental.  If you find something that doesn't work correctly, please speak up.

Dates are converted to the format `YYYYMMDD`.  That is the format for the `Value` that must be used on the Property Filter dialog.  

Many numbers, notably those exposed from the variable table, include units.  The program needs to strip them off before comparing.  Currently only distance and mass units (`in`, `mm`, `lbm`, `kg`) are handled.  Please ask if you need others.


### Error log display 

If errors occur during processing, the log file is automatically opened in Notepad (Thank you @Martin Bernhard).  Previous behavior was to simply notify the user of its location.  The file is still saved to the input directory.


### File wildcard search

Changed from a text box to a combo box.  Keeps the user from having to remember the sometimes arcane wildcard syntax.  Added the ability to delete entries that are no longer needed.


### Task list input options

Each input option is now disabled unless a selected task requires it.  This makes it easier to see what options need the user's attention.


### Readme

The first time Housekeeper is launched, focus is given to the Readme tab.  

Added a link to the Solid Edge Community Forum for user feedback.

Added a better explanation of the TODO list and its use.


### Top level assembly search option

Fixed an issue where Top down search crashes if `FastSearchScope.txt` is blank (Thank you @JayJay101).


### Underconstrained profiles

Fixed an issue where Sync Used Sketches were reported as underconstrained.


### Interactive Edit

Not saving the file, or cancelling processing, is no longer reported as an error in the log file.






## v0.1.9 Enhancements/Fixes

### Update drawing border from template

Added the ability to do a simple drawing border replacement.

Unlike the similar task 'Move drawing to new template', this only replaces the background sheet.  It does not attempt to update styles or anything else.

### Update design for cost

Added the ability to update Sheetmetal Design For Cost properties (Thank you @MonkTheOCD_Engie).  

An annoyance of this command is that it needs to open the DesignForCost Edgebar pane, but is not able to close it.  The user must manually close the pane in a subsequent Sheetmetal session.  The state of the pane is system-wide, not per-document, so closing it is a one-time action.  

### Fit pictorial view

Added options for dimetric and trimetric views.  Previously only isometric was supported.  The option is set on the Configuration Tab.

Moved the 'Hide constructions' functionality to its own task.  Previously it was part of the 'Fit iso view' task.

Fixed an issue where some construction elements were not hidden correctly in assemblies (Thank you @Fiorini).

### Save As

For model files, added bitmap image output formats.  

For draft files, added an optional watermark.  It can be positioned and scaled as desired.  The original file is unchanged.

### Update material from material table

The log file now reports which material properties were updated.  Previous behavior was to simply state that an update had occurred.

Disabled checking the seVSPlusStyle property.

### Update face and view styles from template

Fixed an issue where existing view styles were sometimes incorrectly marked 'in use' and could not be changed.

Fixed an issue where the Color Manager base styles were not updated.

### File names

Fixed an issue where a tilde '~' in the file name caused an error.  

Added a check for path names exceeding the maximum length.

### README font size

Changed the font to match that of the file list box.  Previously it was set to the system default.


## v0.1.8 Enhancements/Fixes

### Open/Save

Added a task to open a file and save it in the current version.

### Top Level Assembly search

Added detection of indexed drives for bottom-up searches (Thank you @Jean-Louis).  Requires a valid Fast Search Scope filename.  See Readme for details.

Added a filter to avoid processing Family of Parts master and unrelated child documents.

### Print Task

Added the ability to override several Windows printing defaults (Thank you @n0minus38).  

Added controls for Solid Edge-specific printing options.

Fixed an issue where the print options were not saved between sessions.  

### Known Issues

Added user feedback on Teamcenter managed files (Thank you @[mike miller]).  

Added an entry on some printing limitations and workarounds.


## v0.1.7 Enhancements/Fixes

### Run External Program

Added the ability to launch a Console App from within Housekeeper.  The idea is to be able to customize tasks to your site-specific requirements.  

The Console App works on a single Solid Edge file.  Housekeeper serves up files one at a time for processing.  It handles the batching, filtering, error reporting, etc.  

Several rules on the program implementation apply.  See details and examples at https://github.com/rmcanany/HousekeeperExternalPrograms

If you could use this, but are not the programming type, your VAR might be willing to help.  If not, you could try waving around a little bit of money on this forum.  It may well bring someone to the rescue.

### Interactive Edit

Added the ability to bring up files one at a time for manual editing.  An always-on-top dialog box lets the user signal when they are finished and ready for the next file.  The main idea is to allow the user to fix errors, such as missing flat patterns, that are not easily accomplished automatically.  Some rules apply.  See the README tab for details.

### TODO List

Added the ability to create a list of files in which errors were detected.  This list can be used as a file search option on subsequent runs.  It is intended mainly to work as a preprocessor for Interactive Edit, but can be used with any task.

### Wildcard Property Comparison

Added the ability to search properties with a wildcard pattern.  It is implemented with the VB `Like` operator, which is similar to the old DOS wildcard search, but with a few more options.  For details and examples, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/operators/like-operator.

### File Filters

Added the ability to narrow the file listing based on file type.  Also added a wildcard search option.

### Missing Drawing

Added a task to find missing drawings for model files.  A current limitation is that the drawing name and directory must both be the same as the model file.

### Property Find/Replace

Added a task to edit property values.  It searches for text in the defined property and replaces it if found.  

The search is not case sensitive, the replacement is.  For example, say the search is `aluminum`, the replacement is `Aluminum`, and the property value is `ALUMINUM 6061-T6`.  The new value will be `Aluminum 6061-T6`.

### Save As

Made Save As more generic by having the user specify the file type from a ComboBox.  Previously, each file type had its own task.

### Save As Flat DXF

Added the ability to save a sheetmetal flat pattern as a DXF file.  Previously, this function was combined with the task 'Save Laser DXF and PDF'.

### Print

Added the ability to print draft files.  

### File List Out Of Date Issue

Fixed an issue where the file list did not update correctly under certain conditions.  Also added a pre-process check to verify that all files on the list still exist on disk.



## v0.1.6 Enhancements/Fixes

### Top Level Assembly

Added a top-level assembly file search option (Thank you @Jean-Louis).  The search can be conducted in one of two ways, bottom up or top down.  

Bottom up is meant for general purpose directories (e.g., `\\BIG_SERVER\huge list of files\`).  

Top down is meant for self-contained project directories (e.g., `C:\Projects\Project123\`).  A top down search can optionally report files with no links to the top level assembly.

See the README tab for more information.

### Property Filter

Added a property filter search.  You identify a condition consisting of a property, a comparison, and a value (e.g., `Material contains Steel`).  Only those files matching the condition are processed.

System or custom properties can be searched.  Multiple conditions can be included.  Filters can optionally be named, saved, modified, or deleted.

Each condition is assigned a variable name, (`A`, `B`, ...).  The default filter formula is to match all conditions (e.g., `A AND B AND C`).  You can optionally change the formula (e.g., `A AND (B OR C)`).

See the Property Filter README tab for more information.

### Help Text

Added extra help text on the README tab for tasks where the label did not fully explain the action (Thank you @bshand).

### Known Limitations

Added a section to the README, listing known issues and possible workarounds.  

### File Select Set

Improved the behavior of the file list select set.  Previously, the select set was cleared whenever a task option was changed.  Now the select set is preserved whenever possible.

### Save Task Selections Now Optional

Previous behavior was to always save.  All other information, such as input directory and template locations, is still always saved.  

### Allow Partial Success on 'Move drawing to new template' Now Optional

Previous behavior was to always allow.

### Readme Scroll Issue

Fixed an issue where the README tab did not scroll correctly.

### Broken Out Section Views Issue

Fixed an issue where `Move drawing to new template` failed on broken-out section views.



## v0.1.5 Enhancements/Fixes

### Move Drawing to New Template

This new task replaces `Update drawing border from template` and `Update dimension styles from template`. It is an improvement because any Styles you modify in your template (even ones I don't know about) will be present in the updated Draft file.

### Save As STEP

Added for Assembly, Part and SheetMetal files.

### Save As DXF

Added for Draft files

### File List

Changed file listbox to multi-column and improved the sort order.

### Widget Positioning

Fixed an issue where form controls were not postioned correctly when the main form was resized.
